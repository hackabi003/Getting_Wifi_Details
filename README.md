# Network Info & WiFi Scanner

This repository contains a Python-based tool that allows you to gather detailed information about your network and WiFi connections, as well as view network speeds. The tool integrates Python, HTML, and CSS to provide both a command-line interface and a simple web-based frontend for displaying the data.

## Features

- **WiFi Network Scanner**: List nearby WiFi networks with detailed information such as SSID, Signal Strength, Encryption Type, Channel, and more.
- **Network Speed Test**: Use the `speedtest-cli` tool to measure your current download and upload speeds.
- **Network Information**: Retrieve IP address and MAC address of your system.
- **Web Interface**: A simple HTML interface displays WiFi details and network information with a user-friendly design.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tool, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pywifi` library (for WiFi scanning)
- `speedtest-cli` (for network speed test)
- A web server to serve the HTML (optional for web-based frontend)

### Installing Python Dependencies

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-info.git
   cd network-info
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install pywifi speedtest-cli
   ```

## Usage

### Command Line Usage

You can run the Python script to gather WiFi details and network information from the command line.

1. To run the script:

   ```bash
   python network_info.py
   ```

   This will display a list of available WiFi networks, along with the network speed (download and upload) and system network information (IP address and MAC address).

### Web Interface

The repository also includes HTML templates to display the network information in a browser.

1. Ensure you have a web server running to serve the HTML files.
   - If you're using Flask (or any other Python web framework), you can create a simple server to serve the HTML.
   - Otherwise, you can open the HTML files directly in your browser, but they won't be dynamic unless you use Flask or another template engine to fill in the data.

2. To start a basic Flask server (optional step):

   Install Flask:

   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

   Then create a simple Flask server in `app.py`:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, render_template
   import subprocess

   app = Flask(__name__)

   def get_network_info():
       # Retrieve network details (IP, MAC, etc.)
       ip_address = subprocess.check_output(["hostname", "-I"]).decode().strip()
       mac_address = subprocess.check_output(["cat", "/sys/class/net/wlan0/address"]).decode().strip()
       return {'IP Address': ip_address, 'MAC Address': mac_address}

   @app.route('/')
   def index():
       network_info = get_network_info()
       return render_template('network_info.html', network_info=network_info)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

3. Create the HTML files and templates for displaying the data. The repository includes HTML templates like `network_info.html` for network info display, and `wifi_details.html` for WiFi details.

4. After setting up the server, you can open the browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view your network info and WiFi networks.

### Example Output

**WiFi Details:**

- SSID: MyNetwork
- Signal Strength: -50 dBm
- Encryption Type: WPA2
- Channel: 11
- Frequency: 2412 MHz

**Network Speed:**

- Download Speed: 100 Mbps
- Upload Speed: 50 Mbps

**Network Information:**

- IP Address: 192.168.1.100
- MAC Address: 00:14:22:01:23:45
